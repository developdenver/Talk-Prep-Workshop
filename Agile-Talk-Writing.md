# Agile Talk Writing Process

## Improvise your talk out loud
* Pretend any visual aids, statistics, examples, etc. already exist
* It will be rough and rambly, potentially really short or really long- this is ok

## Reflect, Improve, Repeat
* Where did the flow break? Where was it boring? Can you cut something out? Were there any jokes or examples you came up with that should definitely make it in?
* What would you need to do it better next time? Slides? Facts? Code examples? A well-written phrase? How little can you get away with?
* Keep the cycle time short- your second run should still be heavily improvised
* After 3-7 iterations, your talk should be taking shape
