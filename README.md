### Agile Talk Writing Process
#### Improvise your talk out loud
* Pretend any visual aids, statistics, examples, etc. already exist
* It will be rough and rambly, potentially really short or really long- this is ok

#### Reflect, Improve, Repeat
* Where did the flow break? Where was it boring? Can you cut something out? Were there any jokes or examples you came up with that should definitely make it in?
* What would you need to do it better next time? Slides? Facts? Code examples? A well-written phrase? How little can you get away with?
* Keep the cycle time short- your second run should still be heavily improvised
* After 3-7 iterations, your talk should be taking shape


### Objective 1: Identify the parts of a strong talk introduction 
* Culture Talk Exemplar: [Zero to SRE by Kim Schlesinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEVssm9VqtA&list=PLbRoZ5Rrl5ldRwunyzYNj1BfudZDorIlN&index=33&t=0s)
    * Note: watch from the beginning to 2:15
* Technical Talk Exemplar: [Test-Driven Development by Example by Toran Billups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b1vcg_XSR8)
    * Note: watch from the beginning to 2:15

### Objective 2: Present a talk introduction that meets the criteria described in the Talk Introduction Checklist

Tips: 
* Outline your intro
* A handful of bullet points
* What will make someone want to pay attention to this talk? Hook them.

### Objective 3: Identify the parts of a strong talk conclusion 
* Exemplar: [Optimizing for Learning by Logan McDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiPYuGWNnz8) 
    * Note: start at 25:15 and watch to the end 

### Objective 4: Present a talk conclusion that meets the criteria described in the Talk Conclusion Checklist 

Write your conclusion...
* A handful of bullet points
* Should mirror your intro- if you were talking about how bad something was in your intro, you should be talking about how good it is with the improvements youâ€™ve made, etc.
* Explanatory: Recap your outcomes
* Argumentative: Restate your thesis and outline how you defended it

### Objective 5: Write the remainder of your talk
* Identify the steps needed to connect the introduction and conclusion
* These should align with your outcomes or the steps needed to defend your thesis- ~1 for a lightning talk, ~4 for a regular talk
* Start making nice slides
